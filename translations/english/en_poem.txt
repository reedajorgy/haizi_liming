//Dawn (1986)//
The deep water before dawn killed me

Moonlight illuminates the neck of midsummer night
The neck harvested in autumn. My people

Autumn gathers eight or nine feet of water
Deep water kills me, husband of rivers
Gathers my head before dawn

Relatives before dawn embrace the jade-carrier of Chu
The only relative
Both legs cut off before dawn

Autumn gathers his legs
Like gathering eight or nine feet of water

That was in May. The deep water before dawn killed me

//Dawn: A Small Poem (1987)//
Dawn
I break free from
A clay pot
Or the bottom edge

My hands thinking of rivers flying
I break free from a clay pot that always carves wheat ears      Sun
I see my own face	Flame
Flickering uncertainly in the dawn wind

I see my own countenance
Flame      Like a sea rising to the sky
Like a quiet heavenly horse
Thinking of rivers flying

//Dawn and Dusk (1987)//
(Two dowries, two sisters)

Dusk destroys itself
Night is beautiful
Night grows larger and larger on the mountain

Horses and sheep     emerge from stone      growing larger and larger on the mountain

White snow falls      in this dusk
Little you secretly offer me
Themselves

My what goddess
What rhythm should I use
To tell you, to serve you
What bleeding should I use
To lick my wounds clean in Shantou
Gaze at the boundless earth
To comfort thus

With "forgetting" my companion
I will take myself out of those torch lights that can recognize faces
From now on embarking on an incurable path

Treating flesh as the last tent on the grassland
Those what weaving women
Spinning wheels reddened by the dusk sky
Blood-colored axles      sounding all night

I submit to them
Sisters of sunset who died under the sword
Taking flight in the night
I submit to dusk's secret flight
Flesh returns to the high sky of night

Two halves of blood-red moon embrace each other
Even today
I still find it hard to tell

Those sentenced by parents and homeland
Yet who love life
Why do they accompany me on the road

My youth      My few revolutionary notes
Carved by refugees on the road onto a wooden bowl begging for life
That bowl once held sunset red as blood and all past life

At death's door

///Dawn (Prelude) (1989)///
(Argentina please don't cry for me)

My chaotic head
Has come from always
Is a freight wagon from somewhere, swaying
Without saying a word, passing my hill
The wagon driver like God, all dirty
Bent over his own knees
Oh wagon driver, sorry for the sleeping whip
Raise your head, wagon driver
On the hill the sky has no end
On the hill the sky is so bright
I am always so desperate
Always like this

***
//Dawn (One) (1989)//
(February snow, February rain)
I sweep the sky and earth clean
Return them to a stranger
I wait lonely, I wait gloomily
February snow, February rain
Spring water flows in vain
For whom do flowers bloom
Always like this beautiful wounded wheat
Exhaling fragrance, standing on the hill

Desolate earth bears the thunder of desolate sky
The upper scroll of the holy book is my wings, infinitely bright
Sometimes like a gloomy today
The lower scroll of the holy book dirty and joyful
Of course also my wounded wings
Desolate earth bears an even more desolate sky

My empty earth and sky
Are the upper and lower scrolls combined into one
Holy book, are my limbs that I have split again
Flowing rain, snow, tears in February

//Dawn (Two) (1989)//
Dawn holds the cup of her own son's blood
Holds me, twin brother of light
Walking in the highlands of ancient Persia
Sacred classical plains

The sun's light like flood spreads over the plains of both banks
Wheat that draws sword-like rays
Travels through India and Tibet
From there I make a long journey, travel through India and Tibet
Between snowy mountains, rocks and lions seeking
The daughter of sky and poetry
Persian highlands are also the summit of my homeland before exile

The highland land that adopts my bright words
Fields are all grain and granaries
Covered by the deep dark mother
Nurturing resentment and blessing
Oh mother earth, your nights all belong to you
Your darkness all belongs to you, give me dawn
Let maidens wear fresh lips like flowers
Let maidens wear flame-like lips for me
Let the skull of primitive night open
Let god rise from my skull
A blood-red light on the battlefield rushes to the sky
Fire within fire, he has a rough name: sun
And revolution, she has a naked body
Walking and vanishing
